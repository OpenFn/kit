'@openfn/cli': minor

Add first pass of apollo command. Call an apollo service with `openfn apollo <service-name>`. For basic help run `openfn apollo --help`. For available services see the server index page. This first release is a super basic integration with log streaming through websockets and reasonably intelligent handling of `{ files }` result data.
